                <p>Elevating the way athletes train and compete, I led the development of the backend system for "Elevate" - an e-sports health and nutrition website powered by Django. Moving beyond my previous PHP experience, I embraced the robust framework to implement a secure, scalable, and feature-rich backend. This involved:</p>
    
            <p> a user dashboard for the Elevate e-sports health and nutrition website, built to empower athletes to optimize their training and performance. This feature-rich dashboard, crafted using Django and vanilla JavaScript, goes beyond simply tracking data it provides a visually engaging and interactive experience to help users stay motivated and informed.</p>
    
            <ul>
                <h3> Exercise Tracking and Completion:</h3>
                <li>View a clear list of planned exercise with intuitive navigation and interactive feedback mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Mark exercises as completed with a simple click, updating the dashboard dynamically to reflect progress.</li>
                <li>Track the total number of completed exercises, adding a sense of accomplishment and motivation. </li>

            <img src="image/cyber.png" alt="" class="cert" >
            <p>I successfully completed a 2-month cybersecurity internship where I delved into the fundamentals of this dynamic and critical field. Throughout the program, I acquired comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in various aspects of cybersecurity.</p>
        
            <p>During this internship, I:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explored the foundations of cybersecurity, including key concepts and principles.</li>
                <li>Gained practical experience in implementing security measures to protect against potential threats.</li>
                <li>Participated in hands-on exercises and simulations to enhance my skills in identifying and mitigating security risks.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with a team of professionals, fostering a dynamic learning environment and gaining insights into real-world cybersecurity challenges.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>This invaluable experience has not only equipped me with a strong understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals but has also honed my problem-solving and analytical skills. I am excited to leverage this knowledge in future endeavors and contribute to the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.</p>

                    <p>Technical Questions: Assessing knowledge and problem-solving abilities related to the job.</p>
                    <p>Problem-Solving: Approaching and solving real-world problems, often with coding challenges for technical roles.</p>
                    <p>Communication: Effectively expressing ideas and communicating solutions.</p>
                    <p>Soft Skills: Showcasing interpersonal skills, adaptability, and teamwork.</p>
                  
                    <dt>Algorithms</dt>
                    <dd>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems or accomplishing tasks. Common algorithms include:</dd>
                    <p>Sorting Algorithms: Arranging elements in a specific order (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).</p>
                    <p>Searching Algorithms: Finding a specific item in a collection (e.g., binary search).</p>
                    <p>Graph Algorithms: Solving problems related to graphs (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search).</p>
                    <p>Dynamic Programming: Optimizing recursive algorithms by storing results of subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence).</p>
                    <p>Greedy Algorithms: Making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.</p>
